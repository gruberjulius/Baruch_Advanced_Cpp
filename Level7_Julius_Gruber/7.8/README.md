C++ modules are a way to divide up code into smaller unit, each responsible for a subtask. This makes it easier to understand and reuse the code. 

In traditional C++ code, header files are used to declare interfaces and definitions. However, they often mix declarations and definitions, leading to confusion and clutter. With C++ modules, the interface and implementation are separated, resulting in cleaner code. 

C++ modules also support information hiding better than header files.  This allows you to hide implementation details and expose only the necessary interfaces to other modules.

Another benefit of using modules is that they reduce dependencies compared to header files. In traditional codebases, including a header file often brings in many other headers that it depends on, creating a long chain of dependencies. This can slow down compilation and lead to conflicts. With C++ modules, you can explicitly import only the necessary interfaces from other modules, reducing the dependency chain. This results in faster compilation times and easier code maintenance.
